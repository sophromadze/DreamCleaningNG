# Continue Booking Feature

## Overview
This feature addresses the user experience issue where users lose their booking progress when redirected to the login page. The "Continue Booking" component appears as a fixed notification in the top-right corner of all pages (except the booking page) when a user has started but not completed their booking.

## Components

### ContinueBookingComponent
- **Location**: `src/app/continue-booking/`
- **Purpose**: Shows a persistent notification to continue booking
- **Visibility**: Only shows when:
  - User is in browser environment
  - There's saved form data
  - User is not on the booking page
  - Booking hasn't been completed

### FormPersistenceService Updates
- **New Methods**:
  - `markBookingStarted()`: Marks when user starts booking
  - `markBookingInProgress()`: Marks when user is actively filling form
  - `markBookingCompleted()`: Marks when booking is successfully submitted
  - `hasStartedBooking()`: Checks if user has started booking

### BookingComponent Updates
- **onInit**: Marks booking as started if saved data exists
- **onSubmit (not logged in)**: Marks booking as started and saves form data before redirecting to login
- **onSubmit (successful)**: Marks booking as completed and clears form data
- **saveFormData**: Marks booking as in progress when user makes changes

## User Flow

1. **User starts booking**: Form data is automatically saved and booking is marked as "started"
2. **User clicks "Book Now" without being logged in**: 
   - Form data is saved
   - Booking is marked as "started"
   - User is redirected to login page
3. **User sees "Continue Booking" notification**: 
   - Appears on all pages except booking page
   - Shows until booking is completed or dismissed
4. **User clicks "Continue"**: Redirects back to booking page with saved data
5. **User completes booking**: Form data is cleared and notification disappears

## Styling
- Uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Subtle pulse animation to draw attention
- Fixed positioning that doesn't interfere with header

## Technical Details
- Uses sessionStorage for form persistence (24-hour TTL)
- Reactive updates using RxJS observables
- Platform-aware (browser-only functionality)
- Automatic cleanup when booking is completed
