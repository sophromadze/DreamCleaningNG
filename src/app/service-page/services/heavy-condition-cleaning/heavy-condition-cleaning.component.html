        <h2>Specialized Heavy Condition Cleaning by Dream Cleaning Near Me</h2>
        <p>Heavy condition cleaning is a specialized deep cleaning service designed for homes that haven't been cleaned for more than 6 months. This intensive service goes beyond regular or deep cleaning to restore extremely neglected spaces to livable conditions.</p>

          <h3>Important Note:</h3>

        <p>Heavy condition cleaning is an hourly service that can be customized if you don't need the entire apartment cleaned. Every apartment is unique and requires individual evaluation. Our hourly rate is <strong>$55 per hour per cleaner</strong>.</p>
