          <h2>About Dream Cleaning</h2>
          <p>
            We started our company in response to real needs and growing demand right here in New York. We noticed a common problem in the cleaning service industry ‚Äî too many companies focused on standardized solutions and overlooked the most important factor: <strong>the customer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why we created a cleaning service built around one clear mission ‚Äî <strong>to put people first</strong> by offering personalized, reliable, and high-quality service tailored to your lifestyle and your space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cleaning isn't just about tidying up ‚Äî it's about creating a sense of comfort, calm, and safety in your everyday life. Whether it's your home or your business, we believe every space is unique and deserves customized attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team is made up of skilled, experienced professionals who understand what it takes to deliver top-tier results. Each team member is carefully trained, background-checked, and equipped to handle everything from routine cleaning to the toughest jobs ‚Äî all with professionalism and care.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're not just a cleaning service ‚Äî we're a partner in making your life easier, more comfortable, and more peaceful. In a fast-paced city like New York, your time and space are valuable. That's why our goal is to deliver not just clean rooms ‚Äî but real peace of mind.
