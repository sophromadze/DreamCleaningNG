      <h2>Why You Need Deep Cleaning Services from Dream Cleaning Near Me</h2>
      <p>Deep cleaning is a thorough, detail-oriented process designed for homes that need more than routine maintenance. We recommend deep cleaning if your NYC apartment or house hasn't been professionally cleaned within the past 3-5 months, or if you don't use regular cleaning services. Unlike standard cleaning, our deep cleaning service focuses on accumulated grime, hidden dust, and those hard-to-reach areas that regular cleaning often misses.</p>
      
      <p>Every home in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens is unique. The duration shown when booking is an average – we don't provide flat rates for deep cleaning. Instead, Dream Cleaning bases pricing on your home's size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, floors, and most importantly – its current condition. We approach each property individually to ensure fair pricing and exceptional results.</p>
      
      <div class="important-note">
        <h3>Important Note:</h3>
        <p>If your home shows signs of heavy neglect – such as thick grease buildup, excessive dirt accumulation, or hasn't been cleaned for extended periods – you may require Heavy Condition or Filthy Cleaning services. Please send photos when booking to ensure proper service selection. If our Dream Cleaning team arrives and determines your space exceeds deep cleaning parameters, we may need to adjust to appropriate service levels with updated pricing.</p>
